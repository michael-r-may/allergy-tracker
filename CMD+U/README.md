# AllergyTracker by Emily Toop

It allows you to do two things, basically;

* Record when you ingest suspected allergens (so, pollen, dust, alcohol, cats, dairy, and so on).

* Record when you experience the allergies you suffer from (Abdominal Pain, Coughs, Dizziness, Sneezing, etc).

The hope is that, eventually, by doing so you, with the help of the app, will be able to spot patterns in your allergies and potential triggers.
